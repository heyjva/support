**Risk of damage to the equipment due to electrostatic discharge.**

Grounding protects the components from the static electricity that can be naturally present (electrostatic discharge, ESD).

- Always: Touch the working surface before touching electronics.
- Ideally: Use ESD protective equipment, such as ESD table mats and grounding cords.
