<!---Powering up the Yellow with CM5 and NVMe after a migration from CM4 with NVMe-->

1. Power up your Home Assistant Yellow

   - Plug in your Ethernet cable and make sure it is locked into place.
   - The other end of the Ethernet cable will need to be connected to your router or switch and connected to the internet.
   - If you are not using PoE, connect the power to the wall and then to the Home&nbsp;Assistant Yellow.

      **Desktop**: Visit [http://homeassistant.local:8123](http://homeassistant.local:8123) to access the Home Assistant user interface.

   2. As your data is stored on the NVMe, your dashboard comes up as usual. No additional steps required.
