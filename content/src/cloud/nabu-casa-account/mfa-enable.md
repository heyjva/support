## About multi-factor authentication

Multi-factor authentication uses a combination of two or three different ways to authenticate your identity:

1. Something you know (like a password)
2. Something you have (like a code generated by a device or service only you have access to)
3. Who you are (indicated by some biometric such as a fingerprint)

If you enable multi-factor authentication for Home Assistant Cloud, in addition to your password, you will be asked for a code from a multi-factor authentication application such as Google Authenticator.

This page shows you how to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Home Assistant Cloud, and how to disable it again later.

## Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Home Assistant Cloud

Step-by-step instructions on enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) to log in to your Home Assistant Cloud account.

### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant version 2025.1.0 or later
- Administrator rights in Home Assistant
- A multi-factor authentication application. For example:

    - [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app)
  - A password manager with authenticator capabilities, such as
    - [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/)
    - If you are using a password manager for this, make sure you have added an entry for your Home Assistant Cloud account.
    - Then, add a section in that entry for one-time password (OTP)
