The Duracell CR2032 shipped with Home Assistant Yellow is estimated to last 10 years or more (with self-discharge taken into account). Replacement likely won't be necessary within the product's lifetime.

If your RTC does not show the correct date, this is likely because the initial time synchronization failed. Make sure that your Internet router does not block NTP (Network Time Protocol) traffic.

In case you do replace the battery, make sure the positive side is facing upwards. You should see the plus sign.
