## About restoring a backup or migrating using a backup

There are two ways you can use a backup:

- You can use a backup to recover your existing configuration on your current system.
- You can use a backup during the onboarding process to restore your configuration. For example, if you want to migrate from another device (such a Raspberry Pi) to a Home Assistant Green or a Home Assistant Yellow.

### Elements included in full backup

A full backup includes the following elements:

- your system configuration
- add-on data
- automations
- scripts
- and media stored on Home Assistant.

Before creating a backup, you can select what to include or explude for a backup.

### Estimated duration

The time it takes to restore a backup depends on your installation. Home Assistant Core and all add-ons are being reinstalled. For a larger installation, this process can take about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
