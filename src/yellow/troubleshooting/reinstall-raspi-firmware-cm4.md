## Symptom

You have a Home Assistant Yellow with a Compute Module 4 and the green LED flashes 4 times short and 5 times long.

## Cause: firmware error

This LED pattern indicates a firmware error on the Compute Module 4 (CM4).

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, you need to reinstall the Raspberry Pi bootloader onto the CM4.

### To reinstall the Raspberry Pi EEPROM firmware on CM4

1. Open the procedure on [re-installing the operating system on CM4](/hc/en-us/articles/25484982657309).
2. Follow steps 1–7 of the section **Option 2: Reinstall Home Assistant OS using rpiboot**.
3. On Windows, open the Command Prompt window (cmd).
4. Run the following commands:

   ```text
   cd \
   cd "Program Files (x86)"
   cd "Raspberry Pi"
   rpiboot.exe -d recovery
   ```

   **Result**: The green LED lights up solid, then starts flashing.

5. Wait for about 1 minute.
6. Then, from Home Assistant Yellow, unplug the power cable.
7. Ensure JP1 is set to UART.
8. On Home Assistant Yellow, connect the power cable.

   - **Result**: The error blink pattern should no longer occur.

     - The LED pattern depends on what is already installed on Yellow.
     - Typically, the system should boot now.
     - If Home Assistant OS is installed, the yellow LED should show a heartbeat pattern after ~5 seconds.
