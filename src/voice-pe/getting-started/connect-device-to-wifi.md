{% step "Talking to Home Assistant" %}
{% image "/static/img/voice-pe/speak.png" "Speech bubbles" %}
{% stepContent %}

   - Start controlling Home Assistant by saying a [supported voice command](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/builtin_sentences/):
     - For example, “What's the time” “Turn on the light in the living room”, “Set the timer to 5 minutes”, “Is the front door locked”.
       - Make sure you’re using the area name exactly as you defined it in Home Assistant.
     - **Troubleshooting**: Is the device you want to control via Assist (for example a specific light) not responding to your voice commands? Make sure the device is [exposed to Assist](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/).
