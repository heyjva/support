   1. Select **Install** and follow the wizard.
   2. When prompted, enter the credentials to your Wi-Fi network.
      - If you have different SSIDs (Wi-Fi network names) for the 2.4 GHz and the 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks, make sure you use the credentials for the 2.4 GHz network, as the device cannot connect to 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks.
   3. Congratulations! You have successfully reinstalled the firmware.
      - **Troubleshooting**: If the reinstallation was not successful, try to [reinstall the firmware from bootloader mode](/hc/en-us/articles/25800285426589).
   4. To add the device to Home Assistant, follow the [Getting started](/hc/en-us/articles/25918770371229) steps.
