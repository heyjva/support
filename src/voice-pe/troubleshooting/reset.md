A device reset deletes the Wi-Fi credentials and the light settings from Home Assistant Voice. The device does not store any other user data. After a reset, the device is ready for a new onboarding process. This may be necessary, for example, when you want to give the device to someone else or if you want to use it in a new environment with different Wi-Fi credentials.
