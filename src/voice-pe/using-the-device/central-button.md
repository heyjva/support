The center button is mainly used to abort current tasks running on the device (a timer ringing, music playing), or to converse without saying the wake word. In addition, the device supports more complex button presses. You can use these to start automations.

The following button presses are supported:

- Double press
- Triple press
- Long press

## To use the center button to trigger automations

- To set up an automation based on a button press pattern (for example, long press), follow the steps on [automating on a button press](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/event/#automating-on-a-button-press).

- {% stepInfo %}Those instructions are based on a Matter device.
- The process is very similar for a voice device.
