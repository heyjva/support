We’ve found an issue in Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 that is the result of a faulty part incorporated in the first batch of Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 devices (sold between June and October of 2024).

- These devices can fail if plugged into certain USB-A ports, but can operate without issue if plugged into most devices.
  - If it’s working, keep it plugged into the device it’s working with. The long coverage period means you don’t need to worry about a replacement until you require one.
- We have instituted a program to provide a replacement device free of charge for a period of 60 months (effective October 2, 2024) for verified purchases.
- Regardless of whether the device has failed, we will provide a replacement upon request.
- SkyConnect branded devices are unaffected by this issue and do not require replacement.
- To request a replacement, please contact the seller where you purchased your device. They will arrange the return process and replacement.
- For more information on the program, [read our blog](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/10/02/connect-zbt1-issue-and-replacement/).
