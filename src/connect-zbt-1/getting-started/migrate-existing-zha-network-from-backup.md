Follow these instructions if you are in the following situation:

- You have a Zigbee2MQTT network running, you no longer have the stick, and you want to migrate to Connect ZBT-1.

Please note that not all settings can be migrated in this case:

- These steps help migrate the network, meaning you won't have to pair all your devices again with Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1.
- However, some higher-level settings cannot be migrated. Elements such as device names may be lost. There is currently no migration path to transfer all settings.

## To migrate an existing Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) network via Zigbee2MQTT backup

{% steps %}
{% step "Creating a Zigbee2MQTT backup" %}
{% image "/static/img/connect-zbt-1/z2m-backup-01.png" "Creating a Zigbee2MQTT backup" %}
{% stepContent %}

1. Under **Settings** > **Add-ons**, open the **Zigbee2MQTT** add-on and select **Open Web UI**.
2. In the Zigbee2MQTT UI, go to **Settings** > **Tools** and select **Request z2m backup**.
   - {% stepResult "A zip file should now be downloaded into your **Downloads** folder." %}

{% endstepContent %}
{% endstep %}

{% step "Unzipping the backup folder" %}
{% image "/static/img/connect-zbt-1/z2m-backup-restore-01.png" "Unzipping the backup folder" %}
{% stepContent %}

- In your **Downloads** folder, unzip the **z2m-backup** file.
  - {% stepInfo %}It should contain a **coordinator_backup.json** file.{% endstepInfo %}

{% step "Stopping the Zigbee2MQTT add-on" %}
{% image "/static/img/connect-zbt-1/z2m-delete-add-on.png" "Stopping the Zigbee2MQTT add-on" %}
{% stepContent %}

- Under **Settings** > **Add-ons**, in the **Zigbee2MQTT** add-on, select **Stop**.
- Zigbee2MQTT uses the MQTT discovery feature to make the Zigbee devices available in Home Assistant. After removing the Zigbee2MQTT add-on, the devices are still present in Home Assistant since the MQTT broker is still holding on to the MQTT discovery messages.
- It is recommended to remove these stale devices from the MQTT broker (see next steps).

- If you don't use MQTT outside of z2m, you can delete the Mosquito Broker integration.
- Under [**Settings** > **Devices & services**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/), select the **Mosquitto broker** integration.
- Select the three dots and in the dropdown menu, select **Delete**.
