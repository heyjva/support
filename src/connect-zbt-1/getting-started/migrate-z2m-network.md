  name: Migrate a Zigbee2MQTT network using Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA)
  position: 3

---

Follow this guide if you have a Zigbee2MQTT network running and want to migrate to Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 and Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA).

>**Note**: this procedure only helps migrate basic network settings to your Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1.
> - Customizations like device names will be lost and automations will need to be updated.
> - Most powered devices like lightbulbs will be re-discovered over time (you can speed this up by rebooting the device) but your battery-powered devices may need to be re-joined to the network for the migration to complete.
>
> There is currently no migration path to migrate all settings and devices.

If you no longer have the old stick, you can migrate via a Zigbee2MQTT backup.

## To migrate a Zigbee2MQTT network to ZHA

{% steps %}
{% step "Stopping the Zigbee2MQTT add-on" %}
{% image "/static/img/connect-zbt-1/z2m-delete-add-on.png" "Stop the Zigbee2MQTT add-on" %}
{% stepContent %}

   - Under **Settings** > **Add-ons**, in the **Zigbee2MQTT** add-on, select **Stop**.
   - Zigbee2MQTT uses the MQTT discovery feature to make the Zigbee devices available in Home Assistant. After removing the Zigbee2MQTT add-on, the devices are still present in Home Assistant since the MQTT broker is still holding on to the MQTT discovery messages.
   - It is recommended to remove these stale devices from the MQTT broker (see next steps).
